			<h3>Alexander&rsquo;s Tour</h3>
			<p>Help Alexander the Great conquer the entire known world. The goal is to mark every square of the board, a bit like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_tour" target="_blank">Knight&rsquo;s Tour</a> math problem. Careful with the corners.</p>
			<h3>The Anabasis</h3>
			<p>Help the ten thousand Greek mercenaries escape Persia alive. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tap your piece to alternate between the knight, the bishop, and the rook</span>. Reach the other end of the board five times to complete the game. It is necessary to finish the game to get a non-zero score. It won&rsquo;t be possible to do it every time.</p>
			<h3>Siege of Troy</h3>
			<p>Defend Troy from the Hellene invasion for 10 years. Gathered loot counts a lot towards the score. Enemy knights will always attack when they can, use that to your advantage. You can tap the square you want your pieces to go to, but you can also tap the piece you want to avoid confusion.</p>
			<h3>Second Punic War</h3>
			<p>Evade Hannibal&rsquo;s attack on Rome long enough to destroy his home town of Carthage. Rounds have 12 turns: you move every turn, enemies move every 3 turns and spawn every 4 turns. At turn 12, enemies spawn and move immediately. Enemy knights will always attack when they can.</p>
